In the past few months, I have received several message requests seeking guidance, help and what not? I have been unbiased in even thinking of helping somebody. And that is how it should be. But...

Let's rewind. No, wait! First read this:

This post is more of an announcement post. I am not really looking for an opinion here. I think, a blog was the best way to write why I will not be helping just everyone from today.

Cool. If you are still here (thank you!), let's start. I have spent my 18 years in a township, quite a distance away from any big city. The first time I entered a mall, was in my first year of undergrad. I was one of those people, who would fear using the escalator. When I first landed to Raipur, I felt the excitement. Computer Science is all I could think of, and I was elated to be able to study it as my core subject in my Bachelors. I was part of the second batch, no alumni, just one batch of seniors. AI was still rising and well known libraries like PyTorch were not yet open sourced. Things were happening. And I could feel the adrenaline rush within me. But...

There was no one to ask for help. Fair enough, the institute was just a year old. When I look back at my journey, I don't think twice before I assert that 99% of the things I did was by myself. I now know how easy it could have been, if I had any mentor to guide me. From the day I started getting hold on myself, I decided I'll help every one I can. No matter who you are, if you come asking for help - I'll be the last person to say no. Over the last couple years, I have been (to my knowledge) helping students in whatever way I can. Things were working out fine, they got help and I was happy seeing them happy. Every day, I will spare 30 minutes for someone who wanted to meet me for an advice. That was the least I could do, I thought. In the final year, as every one would go for an internship, I also did. I travelled to the US for my internship, and life happened.

Things changed: friends suddenly had no time for me, I got busier but felt alone and more unknown faces asked for help. When they shoot me a message, they may not realize how busy I am, but I still help. It has given me great pleasure to be able to help, but I made a mistake. I expected them to value my advice when they ask for it. In my defense, when I am giving my precious time to somebody, I want (not just expect) people to respect it. Because it's my time which I have traded for their help. Every day, someone will come with a question and I will help. I was unbiased. I will help them no matter who they are. But then I realised, I don't work for an NGO to help everyone. I'm still 21 (/young) and I have my own life to live. I had my family to be taken care off (and they deserved all my time). I needed time for myself. But then, I didn't want to say no as well. So I started monitoring every one who would ask for help, to see if they gave enough value to it. Turned out, they didn't (except a couple of them). They were still making the same mistakes that they did before, and I recently concluded: I wasted my time and energy. It wasn't worth it. It's unfortunate but now...the door has closed.

Surprisingly, it didn't work out with my friends as well. When...

When I asked for help. They started backing off. Trust me, I have lived in the desert for 18 years, but my circle was now more deserted than the Great Thar Desert. They had innovative reasons (and sad emojis) to not be able to help. And I could sense a lesson. Not every body I called a friend, was my friend. But I was too nice to not quarantine (because it's a popular term now?) myself from them. I realised the importance of saying no. And now I will.

Time for conclusion. For those who have been in touch, and have talked enough nonsense about me behind my back - will see a difference. For those who have asked for help previously (or will ask for help in near future) - I'll be biased, and judge based on what I know about you before I offer my time and energy. For those who have valued my advice, I'll still be there to help you out in the best way I can. This is purely because I've my own life to live, own endeavors to achieve and family who deserves more time.
